# MariaDB Galera Helm Values
#
# SWARM EQUIVALENT: You don't have clustered MariaDB in Swarm.
# This is an upgrade - 3 nodes, multi-master, synchronous replication.
#
# Galera Cluster means:
#   - ALL 3 nodes accept reads AND writes (multi-master)
#   - Data is synchronously replicated (no data loss on failover)
#   - Lose 1 node? Other 2 keep serving. Zero downtime maintenance.
#
# Install with:
#   helm install mariadb bitnami/mariadb-galera -n databases -f helm-values.yaml
#
# The Helm chart creates:
#   - StatefulSet: mariadb-galera-0, mariadb-galera-1, mariadb-galera-2
#   - Service: mariadb-galera.databases.svc (load-balances across all nodes)
#   - PVCs: 3 x 8Gi persistent volumes (one per node)
#   - Secrets: auto-generated from passwords below
