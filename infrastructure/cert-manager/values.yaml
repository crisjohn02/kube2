# cert-manager Helm Chart Values
# These are the values we passed to: helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager
#
# SWARM EQUIVALENT: This replaces the certificate resolver section in your
# traefik-stack/config/traefik.yaml:

#   certificatesResolvers:
#     production:
#       acme:
#         email: cris.tarpin@splitsecondresearch.com
#         storage: /ssl-certs/acme.json

#
# In Swarm, Traefik handles Let's Encrypt directly.
# In K8s, cert-manager is a separate controller that manages certificates
# and works with ANY ingress controller (Traefik, Nginx, etc.)
#
# To apply changes: helm upgrade cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager -n cert-manager -f values.yaml

# Install CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) - these define new resource types:
#   - ClusterIssuer  (who issues certificates)
#   - Certificate    (a specific certificate request)
#   - CertificateRequest, Order, Challenge (internal resources)
